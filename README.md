# KDirStat

## What is it?

KDirStat was a graphical disk usage utility for KDE 3, very much like the Unix
"du" command. In addition to that, it came with some cleanup facilities to
reclaim disk space.

**But it's history now.**

Use the newer QDirStat instead:

This repository here exists only for historical reasons. This old KDE 3 based
KDirStat is no longer maintained.

### QDirStat (recommended)

QDirStat is independent of any KDE libs or KDE environment; it only needs the
Qt runtime libraries. It runs on any graphical Linux/Unix/BSD desktop. QDirStat
is written and maintained by the original KDirStat author.

### K4DirStat

K4DirStat is a port of the old KDE 3 -based KDirStat to KDE 4 / Qt 4 and later
KDE 5 / Qt 5. QDirStat is independent of that; it is based on the old KDirStat
directly.
